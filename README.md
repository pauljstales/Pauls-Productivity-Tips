## Purpose of this Document
The goal of this document is to try to provide actionable tips (meaning things you can follow without thinking about them much).
Not all of this advice is for everyone - that is okay! If just one thing helps you, that is great!

## Improving your State of Mind

### Removing Negatives

1. **Avoid Negative Stimuli**: Recognize when a stimulus is negative and remove it entirely: no putting yourself down, no living in the past, no bad media (social media, news, gossip, drama)
2. **Accept Failure, and Act Anyway**: Humans are meant to learn via failure, toddlers understand this innately when learning to walk. Anyone afraid to lose can stop worrying about winning.
3. **Climb the Mountain, Even When Alone**: People will become content, discouraged, or move into another direction - climb on
4. **Overcome Roadblocks**: Figure out what you do not know, do it better if it was done before, remember why you started when all seems lost, and never let a single bad grain of rice ruin the entire bowl
5. **Trust the Process, No Farm Overnight**: Whenever you feel progress is taking too long or that your efforts are meaningless, consider that nature is patient, takes the right steps at the right time, maintains balance - and the flowers bloom, every year.

### Embracing Positives

1. **Get Sleep, Eat Right, and Exercise**: Sleep sufficiently (~8 hours regularly, no late screen use) and eat right (more water, less caffeine and junk food) to have the energy to exercise, and let exercise help with stress, anxiety, and depression
2. **Sit in Silence Daily**: Sit in silence daily for 10 minutes, attempting to focus on nothing; this can help clear the mind, remove anxiety and stress, and help you find more silence and focus along the way - boosting happiness and performance
3. **Find a True Desire**: Before we begin to act on anything, we must understand why we want it and what the end result will be; this “soul’s desire” will be what gives us the strength to commit and act - and a lack of one quickly gets filled with meaningless things
4. **Create and Have Fun**: Not everything has to be well-executed, high-quality, marketable, monetizable, or even good… the fun of creation is its own reward
5. **Celebrate Every Small Win, and Win Often**: Celebrate the small wins of progress, but ride the wave of good feelings into action (before they fade) and gain even more progress - remember, a single 5 minute action can be celebrated as a victory!

## Preparing for Action

### Making a Productive Environment

1. **Eliminate Temptations**: A house without snacks can lead to better diet, a workspace without social media and games can be more productive - remove the temptation entirely
2. **Keep it Clean and Minimal**: A cluttered environment can be stressful, keep your work area clean and only the essentials (e.g. items used daily) visible, everything else can be in arm’s reach but out of sight
3. **Add Happiness**: Whatever small finishing touches make you happy - a plant, a painting, sunlight, incense - need to be there to boost your mood and productivity
4. **Distractions: Eliminate, Schedule or Write Down**: Eliminate what is not essential (no TV, no noisemakers, no social media), schedule what is essential but can be done at regular times (email, checking phone, etc.), and write down the rest to be dealt with later
5. **Prepare for Tomorrow, Today**: Do not leave things undone today that will negatively affect tomorrow, make sure clothes are clean for tomorrow’s workout, dishes are washed for tomorrow’s cooking, etc.

### Managing Time

1. **Avoid Decision Fatigue**: Only major consequences with permanent damage require long waiting and thinking, everything else can be picked at random (either no consequences, or easily fixed)
2. **Do Anything, But Not Everything**: Decide one thing you wish to accomplish, and focus on that one thing - better one thing done, then none
3. **Block Time and Check Off**: Block out (N+M) times a week to do something N times (flexibility), and check each completed time (accountability) - daily activities should be 5 checks for 7 blocks
4. **Schedule a Little, Act a Lot**: Write all the detailed actions to be taken for the month in one day, then spend the rest of the month acting without redoing the schedule - keep track, write notes, and update the schedule intelligently next month
5. **Use Timers and Timeboxes**: Use a timer for several reasons; alerts you for break times if you were productive, recalls you away from distractions, and can force you to deliver something rather than nothing by boxing the time to do it

### Stopping Procrastination

1. **Find and Fix the Root Cause**: Do NOT be upset with yourself, find the emotional (fear frustration, anger, self-doubt) or physical (lack of sleep, hunger, thirst) root cause, fix it, and get to work
2. **Clarify the Confusion**: If unsure where to start, break the vague task down into subtasks and break those down into microtasks (~4 hours to complete), then get started on work with confidence
3. **Be Realistic about Effort and Result**: Let go of unrealistic expectations and embrace the real situation (you cannot remain dry and picture perfect while winning a tough race)
4. **Fix or Forget, then Relax**: Fix problems with serious consequences, ignore problems with minor consequences, and then relax and focus
5. **Just Commit to a Little Bit**: Do something for just 20 minutes, then you can stop if you aren't yet in the zone (you likely will be)

## Taking Action

### Learning

1. **Take Action Alongside Academics**: Reading books can be helpful, but you must act and apply; swimming is a lot more about being in the water than the classroom
2. **Practice Deliberately**: Break large skills into subskills, and subskills into the smallest piece possible (e.g., for basketball, just a right-handed layup) - then practice those pieces intensely one day at a time
3. **Use Timers for Work Blocks**: Deliberately practice in a large two hour chunk, breaking that into smaller pieces with very small standup and stretch breaks - then take a longer break
4. **Engage Resources at LEAST Twice**: Engaging with learning materials twice is very effective, even if one or both is just casual consumption (e.g. pre-reading), any format is fine (books, podcasts, documentaries, etc.)
5. **Revisit Regularly**: You will forget everything you learned over time, so revisit things regularly but leave space between visits. This "spaced repetition" will keep it fresh in your mind - and even improve upon your previous understanding.

### Applying

1. **Focus on One at a Time**: Stop multitasking, and do one thing at a time - you may not realize the performance difference, but others will
2. **Complete the Bare Minimum List First**: Some days will not be productive for one reason or another - to salvage these days, come up with a "bare minimum list" and finish at least those things
3. **Fix the Fires as They Arise, then Fireproof**: When a new fire arises, deal with it before it burns all progress away, then fireproof - dealing with the same fire more than once is wasted time and effort
4. **Create Your Own Luck/Flow**: You will find more luck, flow, and success by just grabbing the dice and sneaking in some free rolls before anyone even notices - be bold and go
5. **Always Deliver**: In the end, only what was delivered counts; a flawed deliverable that can be fixed is far better than no deliverable at all - so make sure you deliver (timebox if necessary)

## Tracking, Analysis, and Adjustments

### Personal Goals

1. **Make it Measurable, and Measure It**: In order to track any progress at all, we need measurements - make it measurable (frequency, accuracy, speed, etc.) and take measurements
2. **Compete Only Against Yourself**: Stop comparing yourself to others (which only hurts your state of mind), measure your own performance, and ensure you are making progress (a mentor can be helpful to improve your techniques and analyze performance)
3. **Do Frequent Iterations and Get Feedback**: The ultimate proof of frequent feedback is found in the survival of species; those that adjust to feedback thrive - do small actions and get frequent feedback
4. **Aim for Growth, NOT Goals or Busyness**: Only growth matters, goals that do not cause growth need to be dropped, work that is not required maintenance is a waste of time
5. **Examine Your Career and Know Your Worth**: You want to be learning or earning - preferably both! If you are doing neither, time to move on. Do not be afraid to interview regularly - interviewing is a skill by itself, AND, it helps you know your worth!

## Relationships and Communication

### Personal Relationships

1. **You Owe Nothing, Say Nothing**: When discussions become arguments, when demands (sometimes contradictory) are made of you, remember that you owe nothing, not even a response - stay silent, move on, maintain inner peace (if you MUST respond, say “That is a good perspective”, and nothing more)
2. **Remain Yourself**: You cannot please everyone without becoming unhappy, you cannot take all advice without losing your own thoughts and feelings; listen if you wish, but your individuality must remain
3. **Channel Energy Inwards**: Anger and hatred would be far less if it cost money rather than just time; channel that energy into self-improvement rather than revenge
4. **Make/Break Friendships**: Make friends with those who truly listen, are encouraging while being honest and constructive, and help you become better; break friends with anyone who does the opposite (you are the average of your friends)
5. **Stay Positive with Good Friends**: Show gratitude all the time, dump emotional burdens infrequently or as needed, and forgive minor transgressions - and expect the same towards you

### Professional Relationships

1. **Take/Give Less Advice**: Before taking advice, consider the person may be unable to do it and unaffected by consequences; before giving advice, consider staying quiet and leading by example instead
2. **Be Skeptical of Words Over Deliverables**: Anyone who prefers to talk about who they are and what they have done should be held as suspicious - genuine people just show their actions and work
3. **Have Deliverables in Hand for Mentorship**: Finding mentorship is an active activity, you start by showing real work and effort, act on all feedback with visible progress, and ask the right questions
4. **Create/Find the High Standard Team**: The team’s highest standard is the lowest performance allowed to exist; raise the bar - if the team fails to meet it, consider moving on
5. **Focus on Committing, Not Consensus**: The entire team will rarely agree on a course of action, but it is important to get everyone on the team to 100% commit, not 100% agree

## The 10 Key Rules (Summary)

1. **No Negativity**: Remove negative things from your life, accept failure as inevitable and positive for growth, and remember patience and persistence - alone or in a team
2. **Stay Positive**: Get your body and mind healthy and ready for work, do what you enjoy doing, and let progress and happiness feed each other into an upward spiral
3. **Environment**: Remove temptations, clutter, and distractions - add some happiness, and always end the day preparing for tomorrow
4. **Planning**: Ignore meaningless things, focus on one important thing at a time, schedule plenty of time to do it, and plan loosely only updating plans every 4-8 weeks (based on real-world feedback)
5. **Procrastination**: Never put yourself down, try to find and fix the root cause (emotional, physical, confusion, staying realistic), and then give it just 20 minutes - if all fails, just call it a day and rest
6. **Acting/Learning**: Take plenty of action by practicing deliberately, engage learning materials at least twice - spaced out for repetition and improved memory retention
7. **Acting/Applying**: Do one at a time on the bare minimum list of goals for the day, then work as best you can for the remainder; if any fires pop up, put them out and fireproof the situation, and remember - only deliveries count
8. **Progress**: Make things measurable and only measure against yourself, act in small iterations and get feedback, and have quarterly check-ins to make sure you are growth, and not just busy
9. **Business**: Focus on providing the best customer experience possible, market when you can deliver at scale, admit fault as things go wrong and fix them, and get updated information on the worth of your services
10. **Social**: Stop giving/taking so much advice, only trust those who have delivered visibly, find mentors by showing your own work and asking the right questions, find the team and friends that make you better, and never burden your team or friends unfairly
