# Paul's Productivity Tips

A collection of the wisdom I have received over the years, condensed into actionable advice. 

# Introduction
Hello, I am Paul J Stales, and this is a huge collection of wisdom I have learned over the years.  

The goal of this document is to try to provide actionable tips (meaning things you can follow   
without thinking about them much). It starts off with some dense, terse "golden rules".   
Further chapters are dedicated to expanding on those rules and the sub-principles behind them.

Not all of this advice is for everyone - some will not apply, and some will be disagreeable to
many who hold different values and beliefs. That is okay! We can all disagree and remain friendly.

But, before you start, please read the most important advice of all - DO NOT try to do everything  
at once, you will quickly get overwhelmed! As the advice mentions many times - focus, do one thing  
at a time, and worry about completion!

I hope this helps you... and I hope it helps me!
